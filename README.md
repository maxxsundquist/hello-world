# hello-world
making this sweet hello-world for a tutorial, because why skip steps in any learning process?
I love to code, never really learned how, and am putting some false starts and setbacks behind me and am comitting to learning.
Even though I think I know some things already, I'm starting from the ground up. Solid foundations are real! 
Also, I like coffee, cats and bats. And tacos.
